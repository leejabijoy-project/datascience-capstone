    "     Clusters 3 and 4 are the most feasible options for starting 'Royal Indian' restaurants. They don't have restaurants that serve any kind of Asian cuisines. So including other Asian cuisines like Thai, Japanese, Arab along with Indian menu is also a good option. Neighborhoods like Auburn Gresham, Beverly View, East Beverly, and Oakland in Cluster 3 doesn't have restaurants as 1st most common venue and also has convenience stores, grocery stores, discount stores and farmer's markets in the vicinity. So they can be considered as good options to start Indian restaurants. Cluster 4 has more of hotels and gyms as the most common venues. So it looks more like a business location rather than a location where people would love to hang out and dine out. Considering this, Cluster 3 seems to be the best cluster for the client to explore options of starting an Indian restaurant."
